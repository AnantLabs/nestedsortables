#summary Documentation for the NestedSortable jQuery/Interface plugin

= Introduction =

The !NestedSortable jQuery Plugin is built on top of the popular Interface plugin. !NestedSortable provides you with a way to easily build lists of elements that can be vertically sorted and nested (eg. one element can be made son of another) at the same time, using "Drag and Drop". It is based on Interface's Sortables and works just like it. Some examples of possible usages:

 * Organizing a table of contents
 * Organizing a list of hierarchical pages (it was originally created with this goal, for WordPress)
 * Organizing categories

Perhaps the easier way to get what it does it by looking at the demo. It was designed as part of a Google Summer of Code project for WordPress, in 2007. 

= Dependencies = 

 * jQuery 1.1 or 1.2
 * Interface 1.2 (only needs the components bellow, in that order)
   * iutil
   * idrag
   * idrop
   * isortable

= Usage =

== Basic Usage ==

Include the dependencies and the plugin itself on your HTML file.

{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="interface.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="inestedsortable.js"></script>
}}}

Include the HTML that represents your nested list. I recommend you to use an UL with LIs to represent the list, but you can actually use any pair of HTML elements that can be nested. The elements that are being sorted (the ones with the "accept" class) should have an ID, so the list can be serialized and sent back to the server.

{{{
<ul id="list-container">
  <li class="sortable-element-class" id="ele-1">
    Element 1
  </li>
  <li class="sortable-element-class" id="ele-2">
    Element 2
  </li>
  <li class="sortable-element-class" id="ele-3">
    Element 3
    <ul>
      <li class="sortable-element-class" id="ele-4">
        Element 4
        <ul>
          <li class="sortable-element-class" id="ele-5">
            Element 5
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
}}}

Add the JavaScript code that will set up your NestedSortable list.

{{{
$('#list-container').NestedSortable(
	{
		accept: 'sortable-element-class',
	}
);
}}}

= TODO for next versions = 

 * Provide an option to limit the levels of nesting that can be used
 * Allow the user to define elements that aren't containers (eg.: nothing can be nested into it). It would allow it to be used for organizing files and folders, for instance.
